# Forth AOC

Advent of Code solutions in [UF
forth](http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/uf/uf.html)

Forth is a stack-based programming language. It is extremely small. UF is a Forth targeting the
[uxn/varvara](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) virtual computer.

I am going to try to work through 2021 using this language/environment as an exercise, and
in preparation for 2022.

A notable challenge will be that I only have access to 64kb of memory. May have to
use swap space of some sort.

Running instructions TBD
